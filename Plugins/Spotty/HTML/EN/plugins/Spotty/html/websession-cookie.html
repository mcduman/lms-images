	<h4>We need a web session cookie</h4>
	<p>
		Unfortunately getting a cookie out of a browser is a bit of manual work. But we'll get you there. Here's how you do this,
		using Google Chrome or one of his siblings. The principle is the same on any decent browser.
	</p>

	<h4>Get to the Development Tools</h4>
	<p>
		First of all you'll have to sign in to <a href="https://open.spotify.com" target="_blank">open.spotify.com</a> with your account.
		Once you've signed in, go to the Browser's Tools menu and select "Developers Tools".
	</p>
	<p><img src="[% webroot %]plugins/Spotty/html/images/dev-tools-menu.png"></p>

	<p>
		Now you should have the Developer Tools open. They can be at the bottom of the Window, or on the side. If it's on the side,
		I'd suggest you use the "dot dot dot" menu on the far right to put the panel at the bottom:
	</p>
	<p><img src="[% webroot %]plugins/Spotty/html/images/dev-tools-dock.png"></p>

	<h4>Grab that cookie!</h4>

	<p>
		Now in the Dev Tools panel:
		<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; padding: revert;">
			<li>select the "Application" tab</li>
			<li>on the left, open the Cookies item and select the Cookies for open.spotify.com</li>
			<li>in the list of cookies, select "sp_dc" and copy its value</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p><img src="[% webroot %]plugins/Spotty/html/images/dev-tools-cookies.png"></p>

	<p>Now you're ready to paste that value in Spotty's settings. Good luck!</p>

	<h4>Groundhog Day</h4>

	<p>Unfortunately the web session cookie has a limited lifespan. It will expire after about a year. Just go through the above procedure once again.</p>
